# Staff Guidelines.
Written by the Teneidae Corporation, allied with the future of Sandbox Enviorments.

This staff guidelines have been designed to empower what makes someone a good administrator. Not only from a discord server, but also in other type of large communities.   
  
 
**These are not rules, these are guidelines that you should always follow when dealing with any kind of trouble, or deals.**  

### How professionalism can change the look of a community.
  
  Bad staff leads to bad moderation, and bad moderation leads to bad communities. In Teneidae we believe the professionalism is the key to solve all problems. Keeping a serious and impartial attitude towards problems will always show the *superiority* that the administrator / moderator has within a community.
  
  To "Look Professional", you just need to follow some standards. Its not just about writing with grammar or being respectful, its about showing that you can always be better than what you are. This leads to **Active Thinking**, when solving an issue with a member, it is necessary to be active thinkers. We have to be impartial, and deal the problem in a space where the other users of the community cant be affected. (Private chats, Channels etc...). 
  
  Following this will grow a good ammount of respect from the community to those who work on it. 
  
  ### It is not about being active.
  
  In Teneiade we are aware of the ammount of staff members that want to keep their communities alive. In fact, they try so hard they just end up failing and causing even more trouble. It is not about being active. It is about knowing when to be active.  
    
Dont do Game Jams every friday if the users are waiting for a website or game to be released. Do it when the website or game gets released. It does not only empower the community in a healthy way, but also improves our latest point, "Professionalism."

### Staff Rules
Being staff doesnt mean you're automatically safe from any kind of trouble regarding your behaviour, it actually is the other way around. It means you will need to keep better track of how you behave within the community, as of our "Professionalism" states.
